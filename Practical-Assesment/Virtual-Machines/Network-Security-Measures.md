# Network Security Measures

From Labs 2 and 3, the following network security measures are covered:

| Security Measure                   | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network Configuration             | Configuring network interfaces with appropriate IP addresses, netmasks, and broadcast addresses to ensure proper communication and segmentation within a network. |
| Firewall Configuration            | Setting up and configuring firewalls, such as UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), to control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined rules.               |
| Network Monitoring                | Using network monitoring tools like Snort to detect suspicious or malicious network activities in real-time.                                                    |
| Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) | Implementing IDS solutions like Snort to monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity or policy violations.                                           |
| Rule-Based Security               | Creating and implementing rules within IDS systems to define specific criteria for identifying and responding to security threats.                                 |
| Signature-Based Detection         | Developing signatures for known attack patterns, enabling security systems to identify and respond to malicious activities based on predefined patterns.       |
| Packet Filtering                  | Inspecting and controlling the flow of network traffic based on criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols to prevent unauthorized access. |
