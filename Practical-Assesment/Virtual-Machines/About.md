# About the Virtual Machines

In order to complete the Practical Assesment, we will use two virtual machines (VMs) in VirtualBox to provide a Linux environment within which to experiment
with `nmap`, `hping3`, and firewalls. This handout does not assume any prior knowledge of Linux as we just need to follow instructions carefully.
